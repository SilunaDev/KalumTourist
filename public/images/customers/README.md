# Customer Images Folder

## Instructions
Place your customer photos in this folder. Name them sequentially:

- **customer1.jpg**
- **customer2.jpg**
- **customer3.jpg**
- **customer4.jpg**
- **customer5.jpg**
- **customer6.jpg**

### Image Specifications:
- **Format**: JPG, PNG, or WEBP
- **Recommended Size**: 400x400px (square)
- **File Size**: Keep under 200KB each
- **Quality**: High enough to look good but optimized for web

### Tips:
- Use square cropped photos for best results
- Customer headshots or group photos work well
- Ensure good lighting and clear faces
- You can add more customers by adding more images and updating the component

### Current Structure:
```
public/
└── images/
    └── customers/
        ├── customer1.jpg (Customer photo 1)
        ├── customer2.jpg (Customer photo 2)
        ├── customer3.jpg (Customer photo 3)
        ├── customer4.jpg (Customer photo 4)
        ├── customer5.jpg (Customer photo 5)
        └── customer6.jpg (Customer photo 6)
```

**Note**: The component currently uses 6 sample customers. You can edit the names, countries, and reviews in the Customers.tsx component file.
